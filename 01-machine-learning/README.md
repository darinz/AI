# Machine Learning

## Overview

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task. The core idea is to build systems that can automatically improve their performance through experience.

Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the most fundamental supervised learning algorithms. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear function.

### Key Concepts:
- **Linear Function**: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ
- **Cost Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Objective**: Minimize the difference between predicted and actual values

### Applications:
- House price prediction
- Sales forecasting
- Temperature prediction
- Economic modeling

## Linear Classification

Linear classification extends the concept of linear regression to classification problems, where the goal is to predict discrete class labels rather than continuous values.

### Key Algorithms:
- **Logistic Regression**: Uses sigmoid function to output probabilities
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Finds optimal linear combination of features
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds optimal hyperplane for separation

### Decision Boundary:
- **Linear Decision Boundary**: A straight line (2D) or hyperplane (higher dimensions)
- **Margin**: Distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. It's particularly useful for large datasets.

### Key Features:
- **Stochastic**: Uses random samples instead of entire dataset
- **Iterative**: Updates parameters step by step
- **Efficient**: Computationally less expensive than batch gradient descent

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize parameters randomly
2. For each iteration:
   - Select a random training example
   - Compute gradient for that example
   - Update parameters: θ = θ - α∇J(θ)
3. Repeat until convergence

### Advantages:
- Faster convergence for large datasets
- Better generalization
- Escapes local minima more easily

## Non-linear Features

Non-linear features allow linear models to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data by transforming the original features.

### Common Transformations:
- **Polynomial Features**: x², x³, x₁x₂
- **Logarithmic**: log(x)
- **Exponential**: e^x
- **Trigonometric**: sin(x), cos(x)
- **Interaction Terms**: x₁ × x₂

### Benefits:
- Captures complex patterns
- Maintains computational efficiency
- Preserves interpretability

## Feature Templates

Feature templates are systematic ways to generate features from raw data, especially useful in domains like natural language processing and computer vision.

### Types:
- **N-gram Templates**: For text data
- **Convolutional Templates**: For image data
- **Temporal Templates**: For time series data
- **Relational Templates**: For structured data

### Advantages:
- Systematic feature generation
- Domain-specific knowledge incorporation
- Scalable feature engineering

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks, capable of learning complex patterns through multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).

### Architecture:
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform data
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions

### Key Components:
- **Neurons**: Basic computational units
- **Weights**: Parameters that determine connection strength
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- **Bias**: Additional parameter for each neuron

### Types:
- **Feedforward Neural Networks**: Basic architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: For image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: For sequential data
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Advanced RNN for long sequences

## Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks by efficiently computing gradients of the cost function with respect to all parameters.

### Process:
1. **Forward Pass**: Compute predictions and cost
2. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients using chain rule
3. **Parameter Update**: Update weights and biases using gradients

### Key Concepts:
- **Chain Rule**: For computing derivatives of composite functions
- **Gradient Descent**: For parameter optimization
- **Learning Rate**: Controls step size in parameter updates

### Challenges:
- **Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients become very small
- **Exploding Gradients**: Gradients become very large
- **Local Minima**: Getting stuck in suboptimal solutions

## Generalization

Generalization refers to a model's ability to perform well on unseen data, not just the training data. It's the ultimate goal of machine learning.

### Key Concepts:
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data
- **Underfitting**: Model performs poorly on both training and test data
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balancing model complexity with generalization

### Techniques for Better Generalization:
- **Cross-validation**: Robust evaluation method
- **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting (L1, L2, Dropout)
- **Early Stopping**: Stop training before overfitting
- **Data Augmentation**: Increase training data variety
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models

## Best Practices

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale features appropriately
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation or removal strategies
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features
- **Data Splitting**: Train/validation/test splits

### Model Selection:
- **Cross-validation**: Robust model evaluation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization
- **Model Interpretability**: Understanding model decisions
- **Performance Metrics**: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics

### Training:
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adaptive learning rates
- **Batch Size Selection**: Balance between speed and stability
- **Monitoring**: Track training and validation metrics
- **Checkpointing**: Save model states during training

## K-means

K-means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data into groups based on similarity.

### Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**: Randomly select k cluster centers
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to nearest center
3. **Update**: Recalculate cluster centers as mean of assigned points
4. **Repeat**: Until convergence or maximum iterations

### Key Concepts:
- **Centroids**: Cluster centers
- **Euclidean Distance**: Common distance metric
- **Elbow Method**: For determining optimal k
- **Silhouette Score**: For evaluating clustering quality

### Applications:
- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Document clustering
- Market research

### Limitations:
- Sensitive to initial centroid placement
- Assumes spherical clusters
- Requires specifying number of clusters
- May converge to local optima
